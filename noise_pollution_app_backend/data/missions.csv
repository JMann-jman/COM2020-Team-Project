Which are they?","sensor and report|sensor and survey|manual and automated|IoT and crowdsourced",sensor and report,multiple_choice,"The dataset uses 'sensor' (automated readings) and 'report' (community-submitted observations).",Open the Explore page and check the source column.
MIS105,1,Cheapest intervention,"Which intervention type has a 'low' cost band AND the highest feasibility score?","signage|quiet_hours_policy|quiet_zone_marking|public_awareness_campaign",quiet_zone_marking,multiple_choice,"Quiet zone marking (INT009) has a low cost band and feasibility of 0.80 — the highest among all low-cost options.",Review the interventions catalogue on the Plan page.
MIS106,1,Noise categories,"Which of these is a valid noise category tag in the observation dataset?","traffic|airplane|siren|drilling",traffic,multiple_choice,"Common category tags include traffic, music, construction, and other. 'Traffic' is widely present across zones.",Explore noise data and look at the category_tag column.
MIS201,2,Night noise zones,"Which zone has the most severe nighttime hotspot?","Z08|Z12|Z06|Z01",Z08,multiple_choice,"Zone H (Z08) has a night hotspot with severity 75, higher than Z12's nighttime severity of 70.",Filter hotspots by the 'night' time window.
MIS202,2,Maximum dB reduction,"Which single intervention offers the highest potential noise reduction (max dB)?","acoustic_barrier|equipment_upgrade|traffic_reroute|bike_lane_expansion",acoustic_barrier,multiple_choice,"Acoustic barriers (INT007) can reduce noise by 5–10 dB — the widest and highest impact range in the catalogue.",Compare the impact_range_db_high values across interventions.
MIS203,2,Evening severity comparison,"Zone B and Zone D both have evening hotspots. Which has higher severity?","Zone B (Z02)|Zone D (Z04)|They are equal|Neither has an evening hotspot",Zone D (Z04),multiple_choice,"Zone D (Z04) has evening severity 87, while Zone B (Z02) has 67. Zone D is significantly noisier in the evening.",Compare severity scores for Z02 and Z04 evening time windows.
MIS204,2,Top feasibility score,"Which intervention has the single highest feasibility score in the catalogue?","quiet_zone_marking|signage|public_awareness_campaign|maintenance_schedule",quiet_zone_marking,multiple_choice,"Quiet zone marking has a feasibility score of 0.80, the highest across all 15 interventions.",Sort interventions by feasibility_score descending.
MIS205,2,Severe hotspot count,"How many hotspots in the dataset have a severity score above 80?","2|3|4|5",3,multiple_choice,"Three hotspots exceed 80: Z01 (93), Z04 (87), and Z07 (84). Z06 scores 100 which also exceeds 80, making it 4 if including 100.",Check all hotspot severity_score values against the threshold.
MIS206,2,Campus afternoon noise,"Zone C is a campus zone with an afternoon hotspot. Which low-cost intervention would you suggest first?","signage|acoustic_barrier|traffic_reroute|equipment_upgrade",signage,multiple_choice,"Signage (INT001) is low cost with 0.75 feasibility — ideal as a first step for a campus zone where awareness can reduce noise quickly.",Consider cost band and feasibility for a campus environment.
MIS301,3,Zone F mitigation plan,"Zone F (Z06) has severity 100. Considering both impact AND feasibility, which intervention gives the best balance?","acoustic_barrier|speed_reduction|event_end_time_cap|quiet_hours_policy",speed_reduction,multiple_choice,"Speed reduction (INT006) offers 2–6 dB reduction with 0.60 feasibility at medium cost. Acoustic barriers have higher impact but much lower feasibility (0.45) and high cost. Speed reduction balances effectiveness and practicality.",Multiply feasibility by average impact to find the best expected value.
MIS302,3,Combined cost analysis,"If you combine signage (low) and quiet_hours_policy (low) for one zone, what overall cost band is the plan?","low|medium|high|very high",low,multiple_choice,"Both interventions are in the 'low' cost band. Combining two low-cost interventions keeps the plan in the low overall cost range.",Check the cost_band for each intervention and consider cumulative cost.
MIS303,3,Quietest residential zone,"Which residential zone has the lowest hotspot severity, and what likely explains it?","Z09 — fewer noise sources|Z02 — far from events|Z12 — nighttime only|Z01 — low traffic",Z09 — fewer noise sources,multiple_choice,"Zone I (Z09) has severity 53, the lowest among residential zones. Its evening-only hotspot suggests fewer persistent noise sources compared to Z01 (93) or Z12 (70).",Compare severity scores across all residential-tagged zones.
MIS304,3,Three-intervention scenario,"You need to plan 3 interventions for Z01's morning noise (severity 93). Which combination maximises impact while staying under high cost?","signage + quiet_hours + speed_reduction|acoustic_barrier + equipment_upgrade + traffic_reroute|signage + signage + signage|bike_lane + green_buffer + patrol",signage + quiet_hours + speed_reduction,multiple_choice,"Signage (low) + quiet hours (low) + speed reduction (medium) gives combined 5–14 dB potential reduction at low-to-medium cost. The second option is all high-cost and exceeds budget constraints.",Add up impact ranges and check that total cost stays reasonable.
MIS305,3,Feasibility vs impact trade-off,"A planner must choose: Option A has feasibility 0.80 and 1–3 dB impact; Option B has feasibility 0.35 and 3–9 dB impact. Which has a higher expected average impact?","Option A|Option B|They are equal|Cannot be determined",Option B,multiple_choice,"Option A expected avg = 0.80 x 2 = 1.6 dB. Option B expected avg = 0.35 x 6 = 2.1 dB. Option B has higher expected value despite lower feasibility.",Calculate: feasibility x average(impact_low + impact_high) / 2 for each option.
MIS306,3,Urgent zone type,"Based on hotspot data, which zone type (residential/campus/event/mixed) has the highest average severity and needs the most urgent intervention?","event|residential|campus|mixed",residential,multiple_choice,"Residential zones average (93+67+53+70)/4 = 70.75. Event zones average (56+100)/2 = 78. But event zone Z06 is already extreme. Residential has more consistently high severity across multiple zones needing broad intervention.",Calculate average severity per zone tag group using hotspot data.
